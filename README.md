# C-documentation
Technical documentation page for the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS. The main idea behind this project is to create a C documentation page wherein we can click on any topic on the left side of the page, and it will load the associated content on the right. The project is a simple and straightforward C documentation page, nothing to fancy. To build this HTML project,I have divided the webpage into two parts. While the left side will contains the menu listing all the topics, arranged in the top-to-bottom style, the right side will have the documentation (description) corresponding to each topic. To include the click function, I have used CSS bookmark.
